# MORTALITY-PREDICTION USING CLASSIFICATION ML MODEL-BY PYTHON
In this repository, a ML model using Classification algorithms (Decision Tree and Random Forest) is formed in order to predict the mortality duration in terms of year.
For this a well-Known real time Mortality dataset is imported and get trained by ML models for giving best results.This accuracy will state that the inputs from user will predict the output in such a
way that the duration is estimated in terms of year.Here our target feature Year tells about the patient's lifespan with basic trained inputs from them.
